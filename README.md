Algorithm-Code-Library
======================

Implementation of some algorithms and data structures. Written in C++. Used by me for programming contestes.
Here, I have also added some solutions so that some ideas of solving techniques and applying algorithms can be obtained.
Contents I have added are as follows.

    Persistenet Segment Tree (SPOJ KQUERY)
    Range-Maximum-Sum Query
    Segment Tree with Lazy Prop
    Sparse Table
    Square Root Decomposition

Geometry
-------------
    Convex Hull 
    geometry template
    point in polygon with shooting a ray technique
    polygon and lattice points with Pick's theorem

Graph Algorithms
----------------

Number Theory
-------------
    Eular phi (Sieve)
    Bitwise sieve and Number Theory template

Sorting Algorithms
-------------------------------------
    Some sorting algorithms tested with UVa problem ( 11462 - Age Sort )
