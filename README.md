Algorithm-Code-Library
======================

Implementation of some algorithms and data structures. Written in C++. Used by me for programming contestes.
Here, I have also added some solutions so that some ideas of solving techniques and applying algorithms can be obtained.
Contents I have added are as follows.

---------------
    Array Compression
    BIT (Binary Indexed Tree)
    MO's Algorithm
    Orthogonal RMQ (with Segment Tree)
    Segment Tree with Lazy Prop

Geometry
-------------
Convex Hull 
geoTemplate.h
point in polygon with shooting a ray technique
polygon and lattice points with Pick's theorem
precode.h

Graph Algorithms
----------------
    2-SAT
    Articulation Point or Cut Vertices
    Bellman Ford
    Bipartite Matching
    SCC (Kosaraju’s algorithm)

Number Theory
-------------
    Eular phi (Sieve)
    Bitwise sieve and Number Theory template

String Algorithms and Data-Structures
-------------------------------------
